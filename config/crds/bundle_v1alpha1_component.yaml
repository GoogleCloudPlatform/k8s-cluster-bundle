                must have `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata`.  This is essentially
                equivalent to the Kubernetes `Unstructured` type.

                breaking changes, minor-versions should indicate backwards compatible
                features, and patch changes should indicate backwards compatible.
                If there are any changes to the component, then the version string
                must be incremented.
